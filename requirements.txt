I'll design a payments dashboard focused on the specific analytics you want to highlight: card usage, bank popularity, and peak sales times. Here's a detailed design for your Visa Payment Network dashboard:

This dashboard design focuses specifically on your requested analytics while providing an intuitive interface that keeps all SQL and database operations hidden from the user. The dashboard presents insights in a business-friendly format while allowing for interactive exploration of the data.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific section of this dashboard design, or would you prefer a more detailed mockup of any particular component?
